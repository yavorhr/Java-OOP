abstract classes), **encapsulation**, **inheritance** and **polymorphism** are studied widely. The course will go into
the most commonly used **design patterns**. Attention will be paid to component testing (writing unit tests) and the
concept of **Test Driven Development** (TDD), the use of **reflection**.
